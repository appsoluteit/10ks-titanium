The 10,000 Steps program aims to increase the day-to-day activity of Australians by encouraging the use of pedometers or activity trackers to accumulate “incidental” physical activity. Significant health and well-being benefits can be achieved simply by moving more very day. 10,000 Steps provides a supportive program with a free, interactive website, mobile app and resources for individuals, workplaces and communities.

This free application will allow you to easily record and view your daily steps, add your moderate and vigorous activity and sync it with your account on the 10,000 Steps website. The app also allows you to view your Tournament progress and join a new Challenge and view your current monthly Challenge progress.

To access your milestone badges, setup daily email reminders, view health articles and other great features, view your account on the 10,000 Steps website.

To contact us or send feedback please do so via the website.

This initiative is funded by the Queensland Government.
