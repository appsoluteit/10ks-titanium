UI stuff:
	- Need a loading spinner, especially while performing an async call
		(in progress)
		(http://alloylove.com/#)
		(currently using https://github.com/FokkeZB/nl.fokkezb.loading)
	
	- Window transitions
	- Include chevrons. Might need to use custom images here - doesn't look like Ti supports them.

Content:
	- Fill in the other areas with content taken from the existing app for now

Functionality:
	- Add 'sync' support
